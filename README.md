It effectively reduces any given integer to its prime factors.
It generates a user-friendly output that clearly displays each prime factor and its exponent, allowing users to understand the prime factorization of the number they enter.
It offers a way to figure out how to prime factorize integers within a given range (50 to 200).
The output is comprehensive, providing a clear format for both the prime factorization and the number reduction process step-by-step.
It makes sure that only numbers that fall inside the permitted range are processed by enforcing input validation.
